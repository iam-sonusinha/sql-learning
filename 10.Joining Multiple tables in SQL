✅ PART 1 — NOTES (EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND EXPLANATION)
📌 Topic: Joining Multiple Tables in SQL (3 or More Tables)
1️⃣ What is Joining Multiple Tables?

When data is stored in different tables, we use JOINs to combine them into one result.
Joining 3+ tables is just like joining 2 tables — you simply add more JOIN statements.

2️⃣ Why Do We Join Multiple Tables?

Real-world data is split into many related tables.

To answer questions like:
“Which customer bought which product and at what price?”
You need data from Customers + Orders + OrderItems + Products → 4 tables.

3️⃣ How Joins Work (Video Explanation)

A JOIN connects rows from one table to another using a common column:

customer_id

order_id

product_id
These act like “bridges” between tables.

4️⃣ Common Types of JOINS Used
INNER JOIN

Shows only matching rows between tables.

If no match → row is excluded.

LEFT JOIN

Shows all rows from the first table and matched rows from the second.

If no match → values become NULL.

RIGHT JOIN

Opposite of LEFT JOIN.

FULL OUTER JOIN

Shows everything from both tables (matching + non-matching).

5️⃣ Joining More Than Two Tables

Structure looks like this:

FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON conditions
JOIN table3 ON conditions
JOIN table4 ON conditions


SQL reads joins one at a time, left to right.

Each join needs a proper join condition.

Missing condition → wrong output or too many rows.

6️⃣ What to Be Careful About

Always join using the correct key.

Outer joins produce NULL values — handle them carefully.

Joining many tables can be slow → indexing helps.

Use aliases (c, o, oi, p) to make queries readable.

7️⃣ Best Practices

Join only required tables.

Select only required columns.

Use GROUP BY when aggregating (sum, count).

Test query output using smaller datasets first.
