EXAMPLES (Simple SQL Queries & Use Cases)
Here are basic SQL examples (for a hypothetical simple table setup) to show how SQL works in practice.

Assume we have a table called Users:
Users
-------------------------
user_id | name   | age | city
-------------------------
1       | Alice  | 25  | Mumbai
2       | Bob    | 30  | Delhi
3       | Carol  | 22  | Pune

Example A — Select (Read) Data
Get all user names and their cities:
SELECT name, city
FROM Users;

Expected result:
name	city
Alice	Mumbai
Bob	Delhi
Carol	Pune

Example B — Select with Condition
Get users who are older than 24:
SELECT user_id, name, age
FROM Users
WHERE age > 24;

Result:
user_id	name	age
1	Alice	25
2	Bob	30
Example C — Insert Data (Add a Row)

Add a new user:
INSERT INTO Users (user_id, name, age, city)
VALUES (4, 'Dave', 28, 'Kolkata');
After insertion, the Users table will include Dave.

Example D — Update Data
Change user’s city for a specific user:
UPDATE Users
SET city = 'Pune'
WHERE user_id = 2;

This will change Bob’s city from Delhi → Pune.

Example E — Delete Data
Remove a user from the table:
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE user_id = 3;
This deletes Carol’s row.
