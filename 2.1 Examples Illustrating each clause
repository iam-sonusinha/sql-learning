PART 2 — EXAMPLES (SQL Queries Illustrating Each Clause)

Assume the following simple table:
Employees
-----------------------------
employee_id | name     | dept  | salary
-----------------------------
1           | Alice    | HR    | 50000
2           | Bob      | Sales | 60000
3           | Carol    | Sales | 65000
4           | Dave     | HR    | 55000
5           | Eve      | IT    | 70000

Example 1 — Basic SELECT & FROM
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees;

Result: All employees’ names and salaries.

Example 2 — Adding WHERE
SELECT employee_id, name, dept
FROM Employees
WHERE dept = 'Sales';

Result: Only those in the Sales department.

Example 3 — Using ORDER BY
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 55000
ORDER BY salary DESC;

Result: Employees with salary > 55000, sorted highest salary first.

Example 4 — Using GROUP BY + Aggregate

Suppose we want average salary by department:
SELECT dept,
       AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY dept;

Result: Each department with its average salary.

Example 5 — Using HAVING after GROUP BY

List departments where average salary is above 60000:
SELECT dept,
       AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY dept
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;

Result: Only departments meeting the average salary threshold.

Example 6 — SELECT * with caution
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE dept = 'HR';

Result: All columns for HR employees.
Note: Use SELECT * only when you genuinely need all columns.

Example 7 — Combining many clauses
SELECT dept,
       COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
       MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY dept
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY highest_salary DESC;

Result:
Departments with more than 1 employee > 50000 salary,

Shows how many employees, the highest salary, sorted by highest salary.
