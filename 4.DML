✅ PART 1 — NOTES (Concepts Covered in the Video: DML / INSERT & Data Manipulation)
🔹 What is DML in SQL
Through DML you can insert, update, or delete rows in your tables (i.e. add new data, change existing data, or remove data).

🔹 Focus on INSERT — Adding Data
The video shows how to use the INSERT command to add new rows into a table. 
YouTube

INSERT is fundamental: once you define a table schema (columns), INSERT lets you fill that table with actual data.
🔹 Other DML Operations (Context)
Though the video focuses on INSERT, “DML” in general includes:
INSERT — add new data
UPDATE — modify existing data
DELETE — remove existing data
Using these you manage and maintain the data stored in the database tables.

🔹 Why DML (and INSERT) is Important
Databases become useful only when populated — INSERT uploads data so queries can retrieve meaningful info.
For dynamic applications (like apps, websites), DML operations allow users to add or update records (e.g. sign-ups, orders, logs).
Understanding DML is critical if you want to build or maintain real-world databases, not just read data.

📝 PART 2 — EXAMPLES (SQL Commands for INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE)
Assume we have a table Students defined as:
Students
---------------------------
student_id | name    | age | city
---------------------------

✅ Example A — INSERT: Adding a New Row
Add a new student:
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, age, city)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20, 'Mumbai');

After this command, the table will have a row for Alice, age 20, city Mumbai.
✅ Example B — INSERT: Multiple Rows (if supported)
Add two new students at once:
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, age, city)
VALUES
  (2, 'Bob', 22, 'Delhi'),
  (3, 'Charlie', 21, 'Pune');

This inserts Bob and Charlie at once.

✅ Example C — UPDATE: Change Existing Data
Suppose Alice moves to a new city. Update her city:
UPDATE Students
SET city = 'Pune'
WHERE student_id = 1;

This finds the row where student_id = 1 and updates city to 'Pune'.

✅ Example D — DELETE: Remove a Row
Remove a student record (say delete Bob’s record):
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE student_id = 2;
This removes the row of student with student_id = 2.

✅ Example E — INSERT Without Specifying All Columns (If Table Allows)
If table Students has an additional optional column (say email) which can be NULL, you can insert with only required columns:
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, age, city)
VALUES (4, 'Dave', 23, 'Kolkata');

Other columns (like email) will remain NULL or default.

✅ KEY TAKEAWAYS (What to Remember)
DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to change data inside tables (not just read).
With INSERT you add new rows; with UPDATE you change existing rows; with DELETE you remove rows.
Always ensure columns and values match in data type and order when inserting.
Use WHERE clause carefully in UPDATE and DELETE — without it, you might update/delete all rows inadvertently.
Insert only needed columns — optional columns can be omitted if allowed by schema.
If you like — I can also produce a mini-cheat sheet for all DML commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, maybe TRUNCATE), with syntax templates + examples + common pitfalls — that can help you practice and refer easily.
Do you want me to build that for you now?
