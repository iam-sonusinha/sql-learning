✅ PART 1 — NOTES (CONCEPTS: What is SQL & Why It Matters)
🔹 What is SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language — a special language used to talk to databases. 
With SQL you can create, read, update, or delete data stored in tables (database operations). 

In short: SQL lets you manage and retrieve data from databases in a structured and standardized way. 
🔹 Why SQL is Important / When We Use It
    Databases widely used in applications (websites, apps, business systems) store data in tables.
    SQL gives a consistent way to ask questions or get data: e.g. “Give me all users who signed up after Jan 2025”, or “What are all orders above ₹1000?”, etc.
    Because SQL is standard and widely supported, learning SQL helps you work with almost any relational database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).
🔹 SQL: Data-centric — not code-centric
    Unlike general-purpose programming languages (Java, Python), SQL is declarative: you specify what you want (e.g. “select these rows where condition X”), not necessarily how to fetch them. This makes it simpler for data tasks.
🔹 Typical Things You Do with SQL
  Create a new database / table.
  Insert data (rows) into a table.
  Query data (read): get specific rows/columns.
  Update data (change existing data).
  Delete data (remove rows).
  These operations make SQL a full toolkit for database data management.
🔹 Why “Visually Explained” Helps
Visual diagrams of tables and data relationships make it easier to understand how tables store data, and how queries retrieve it.

For beginners, seeing tables as “grids” helps you grasp how SQL selects and filters data.
