✅ PART 2 — NOTES (Concepts: The SELECT Statement & Clauses)
Breakdown of the key components/clauses inside a SELECT statement.

Visual explanation of how data is retrieved from tables via SELECT.
🔹 Key Clauses of SELECT
  SELECT: What columns you want to see.
  FROM: Which table(s) you are pulling data from.
  WHERE: (Optional) Filter the rows by some condition.
  GROUP BY: (Optional) Aggregate rows sharing a common attribute.
  HAVING: (Optional) Filter after grouping.
  ORDER BY: (Optional) Sort the results.
  LIMIT / TOP: (Optional) Restrict number of rows (depending on SQL dialect).

🔹 How it works (visually)
Imagine a table as a spreadsheet with rows and columns.
SELECT column1, column2 → pick the columns you want.
FROM table → specify the table to look into.
WHERE condition → choose only rows where the condition holds true.
If using GROUP BY, think of collapsing rows by a chosen column and then applying aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc.).
ORDER BY sorts by a column (ascending/descending).
You can combine multiple clauses to form powerful queries.

🔹 Why understanding SELECT thoroughly matters
It’s the most frequently used SQL statement.
Almost every data retrieval task begins with SELECT.
Without selecting correctly, your downstream operations (joins, aggregates, analytics) may be wrong.

🔹 Tips & things to watch
When you use SELECT *, you fetch all columns — but only use if truly needed (performance & readability).
Always qualify column names if multiple tables with joins are used (to avoid ambiguity).
Use meaningful aliases for tables and columns for clarity.
If using GROUP BY, any non-aggregated column must appear in GROUP BY.
WHERE filters before grouping; HAVING filters after grouping.
Sorting large result sets might slow performance; only sort if needed.
