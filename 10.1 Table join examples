✅ PART 2 — EXAMPLES (ALL SQL QUERIES SEPARATELY)

Here are easy and clean examples of SQL queries joining 3–4 tables.

🧪 Example 1 — Joining 2 Tables (Basic Start)

Get customers and their order details:

SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

🧪 Example 2 — Joining 3 Tables

Find total items ordered by each customer:

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    o.order_id,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_items
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN OrderItems oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id;

🧪 Example 3 — Joining 4 Tables

Show customers → orders → items → product details:

SELECT
    c.name AS customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    p.product_name,
    oi.quantity,
    oi.unit_price
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN OrderItems oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN Products p
    ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

🧪 Example 4 — LEFT JOIN with 3 Tables

Show all customers, even if they have no orders:

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    o.order_id,
    oi.product_id
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN OrderItems oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id;


(If a customer has no order → order_id becomes NULL)

🧪 Example 5 — FULL JOIN Example

Show all customers + all orders (even unmatched):

SELECT *
FROM Customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
